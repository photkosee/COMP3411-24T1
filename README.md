# Artificial Intelligence COMP3411 2024 Term 1

## Course Summary

Artificial Intelligence is concerned with the design and construction of computer systems that "think". This course will introduce students to the main ideas and approaches in AI - including agent architectures, search techniques, game playing, probabilistic reasoning, logical inference, machine learning, neural networks and deep learning.

## Learning Outcomes

Students successfully completing this course will have a working knowledge of the AI methods presented, and will be able to demonstrate their knowledge by explaining certain features or aspects of these algorithms, working through examples, and by describing how the techniques might be applied to particular problems. Students will gain practical experience, through the assignments, of what is involved in designing and implementing a functional AI system.
